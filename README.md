Mastermind Game

This is a fun and challenging game where you try to guess a secret code by making educated guesses and receiving clues based on your attempts. The mastermind code is a sequence of 4 colored pegs. The player has 12 chances to guess the code. With each guess, the player receives feedback in the form of black and white pegs.

A black peg indicates a correct color in the correct spot.
A white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong spot.
The player wins if they can guess the code within 12 tries.
